# 2D-Top-Down-Player-Movement
Player Movement for Top down 2d Games
To make this work you will need to add a 2d rigidbody to the player and set the gravity to 0.
Also make sure you set a speed on the Script otherwise the player will not move


"PlayerMovementTopDown" - simple Up,Down,Right and left directions 
"Player" File - Same as above but also rotates depending where your mouse is pointing

- ONLY Add 1 file to your player
- set GRAVITY to 0
